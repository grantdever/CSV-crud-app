<h2>View</h2>
<p>This web app has routes which enable you to view all of the users and groups inside of your database, both individually and in total.</p>
<p>If there is no data entered into the database or it is improperly configured, then the information will not be displayed.</p>
<p>Likewise, if your database entries contain improper values then there may be issues with the view.</p>
<p>Use the navigation buttons below to test the routes.</p>
