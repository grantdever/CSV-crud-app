<h2>Welcome to my first CRUD application!</h2>
<p>This app: </p>
<ul>
    <li>enables users to upload an .csv file</li>
    <li>validates that they are uploading an .csv</li>
    <li>validates that the headers are correct</li>
</ul>
<p>If the .csv file contains the proper headers and the db is configured:</p>
<ul>
    <li>this data will stored in a variable</li>
    <li>this data will be posted to an end point and the data will be added to the database</li>
    <li>the user will be notified that this has successfully occurred</li>
    <li>the user can navigate to the appropriate routes to view this data</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my first full stack project. It is built with: Angular, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, and NestJS.</p>
<p>You can test it out by navigating to the upload user(s) or upload group(s) page.</p>
